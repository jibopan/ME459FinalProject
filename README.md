# ME459FinalProject
ME459 Final Project Proposal

Problem statement: 
We will use Python to create one or more mini-games, or two-player games if possible. And make a management interface of the game, which user can choose his favorite games and modes.
The first mini-game we envision is similar to 'Tank Battalion', which the player controls the ‘badger’ and attacks 'enemies', such as another college's mascot, or ‘GPA monster’, in a map with obstacles.


Motivation/Rationale: 
Most of us first used computers and liked them because of video games, we grew up with many classic video games. I thought it would be cool if we could make our own game and combine our school mascot, Badger, with a classic game. And it was a really cool thing to tell my friends that I made a game in this awesome course.


How you plan to go about it: 
1.	The game management interface opens.
2.	Game Map Design and movement rules.
3.	User controlled badger movement and attack.
4.	The enemy's immediate movement and attack.
5.	Judgment of victory or defeat conditions.


ME459 aspects the proposed work draws on: 
1.	Properly use of different data type.
2.	Different operators and the precedence of different kinds of operators.
3.	Different loop structure.
4.	Passing parameters between functions.
5.	Get I/O input. 
6.	Use standard library and build our own library. 
7.	Calling built-in function and define our own function. 
8.	Calling sub-function in main function.


How you will demonstrate what you accomplished: 
Our goal is to complete the design of the game interface and to complete a mini-game.

Deliverables: 
There are .exe and .py files that users can use to access the interface, select the game they want to play and be able to play at least one mini-game.


Other remarks: 
Although our project has nothing to do with academic research, making a game is one of my dreams, and it motivates me to learn code. Now people can no longer leave the computer and programming, and the development of games has also promoted the progress of computers, such as CPU and GPU. Games may be one of the motivations for people to explore higher performance computing.
